It wasn't just a teacher to me, it was someone who changed a way of singing the song before I met him, I heard my song, it was too difficult and I always gave up that I couldn't serve the poem. But Mr. Lee had a special way of teaching. Instead of just writing formulas on the board, he used real-life examples to explain things. For instance, he taught friction by cutting an apple into pieces and he made a geometry fun by asking us to make our objects in the classroom. One day, after I felt a test, he called me to his office. I thought he would scold me, but instead he said, mistakes are part of learning. Let's see where you went wrong. He spent an hour going through each problem with me patiently. He also told me, math isn't about being fast, it's about being careful. It starts a little more than a day. I even began to enjoy some problems. More importantly, I learned that her work and patience can overcome and give courage. Now, whenever I faced the situation, I remember his words, I will always be grateful to Mr. Lee for teaching me not just math, but also a valuable life lesson.",
