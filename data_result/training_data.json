    "plain": "Okay, well this was a really tricky topic because there's so many inventions and innovations that have changed the world. There's computers, the internet, credit cards, virtual money. It was really difficult actually to choose just one of them, but in reflection I think the biggest and most significant invention to have changed the world is social media. I mean if you look at Facebook and Twitter and those kinds of platforms, there's no doubt that they've had a huge profound impact on our lives. And the good thing is that with the coming of a global world we're now able to communicate with friends and family across the world instantly. I mean I think that's wonderful. And also just for things like birthdays, that's really handy to have as well just to be updated with things like that. But I just wonder if in reflection if the disadvantages and drawbacks to social media are on our weighing the benefits. So if you think about them who are posted things online and you know comments and photographs and then as they get older they suddenly regret that picture of themselves being up there. So yeah I think there's definitely disadvantages. Also it can just be used as a platform for people to get at each other. So attacking politicians or bullies at school or celebrities based on something that they've said. So yeah and then there's the playing around with our personal information to manipulate political elections. I mean that is frightening.",

It wasn't just a teacher to me, it was someone who changed a way of singing the song before I met him, I heard my song, it was too difficult and I always gave up that I couldn't serve the poem, but Mr. Lee had a special way of teaching. Instead of just writing formulas on the board, he used real-life examples to explain for instance, he taught friction by cutting an apple into pieces and he made a geometry fun by asking us to mirror objects in the classroom. One day, after I felt attached, he called me to his office. I thought he would scold me, but instead he said, mistakes are part of learning. Let's see where you went wrong, he spent an hour going through each problem with me patiently. He also told me, math isn't about being fast, it's about being careful. Math isn't about being fast, it's about being careful. Sixth to him, a start, a start, a start, practicing little everyday. Stully, my grades improved and I even began to enjoy some problems. More importantly, I learned that her work and patience can overcome any difficulty. Now, whenever I faced the situation, I remember his words, I will always be grateful to Mr. Lee for teaching me not just math, but also a valuable life lesson.",

I barely had time to eat properly just sandwich or instant noodles. Even my friends noticed I looked tired because I had dark circles out of my eyes. The worry part was the lick of the lick. I already slept only 4 to 5 hours a night. One time I fell asleep while studying and woke up with my fish on the textbook. My mom kept telling me to take breaks. But I was too stressed. I kept thinking what if I fail. Families examined me. I got my results. I was surprised. I passed my exam and my history grade was in better than expected. Looking back, I realized I should have planned my time better instead of planning everything at the last minute. Now, I try to study a little area to avoid that kind of stress again.",

  "New+technological+device.m4a": {
    "plain": "So you asked me about a new technological device that I have started using recently, so about technology. We all love it, don't we? I myself like to own or use technological devices, but it's not always easy for me to obtain them, because most of them are very expensive. So fortunately, a new technological device that I started using recently was an iPhone. Now in our country, young children are not allowed to have their own personal mobile phone until the age of 17 or 18, same with the case with me. I used to take my mother's phone for a few hours, and then I would have to return it to her. But when I got my own personal phone before university, at first it was really hard for me to understand all the features, because they were very different from Android. But slowly but surely I got hold of it. And then I installed all the social media apps, I tried connecting with all of my friends, the old ones. And it was fun, I started using watching a lot of Netflix shows, and then my university started and I had to travel by myself. And there we have an app, a transportation app that's similar to Uber, so you could easily navigate all the maps and also the Google searches. So I think the main purpose of technology is to make your life easy, and it did fulfill the purpose for me during the time of COVID. We were taking online classes, and it really helped me at that time. It was very easy for me to get enrolled in course mode use and see video lectures online. And yeah, I think I did fulfill the purpose. Wait!",
