  "Describe+a+person+who+taught+you+something+important._T263.m4a": "I&#x27;d like to talk about my middle school my teacher, Mr. B. It wasn&#x27;t just a teacher to me, it was someone who changed a way of singing the song before I met him, I heard my song, it was too difficult and I always gave up that I couldn&#x27;t serve the poem. But Mr. Lee had a special way of teaching. Instead of just writing formulas on the board, he used real-life examples to explain things. For instance, he taught friction by cutting an apple into pieces and he made a geometry fun by asking us to make our objects in the classroom. One day, after I felt a test, he called me to his office. I thought he would scold me, but instead he said, mistakes are part of learning. Let&#x27;s see where you went wrong. He spent an hour going through each problem with me patiently. He also told me, math isn&#x27;t about being fast, it&#x27;s about being careful. It starts a little more than a day. I even began to enjoy some problems. More importantly, I learned that her work and patience can overcome and give courage. Now, whenever I faced the situation, I remember his words, I will always be grateful to Mr. Lee for teaching me not just math, but also a valuable life lesson.",
