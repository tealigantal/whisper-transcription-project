For instance, he taught friction by cutting an apple into pieces and he made a geometry fun by asking us to make our objects in the classroom. One day, after I felt a test, he called me to his office. I thought he would scold me, but instead he said, mistakes are part of learning. Let&#x27;s see where you went wrong. He spent an hour going through each problem with me patiently. He also told me, math isn&#x27;t about being fast, it&#x27;s about being careful. It starts a little more than a day. I even began to enjoy some problems. More importantly, I learned that her work and patience can overcome and give courage.
